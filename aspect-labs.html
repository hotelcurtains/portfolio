  <h1>welcome to aspect labs</h1>

  <h2>story</h2>
  <p> Aspect Labs, a controversial research and development company that was in no way inspired by any Valve Corporation® properties, has some bleeding-edge  parkour technologies it is eager to bring to market; however their practical trials have proven, according to company lawyers, inconclusive due to participant unwillingness and mortality. They need you to test their tech, and you need the money they offer participants. Prove that you are smart enough to survive the trials and then, well, survive the trials.
  </p>

  <h2>gameplay</h2>
  <p> You'll switch between escape room-esque "Dangerous Intelligence-Confirmation Kennels" that test your Minecraft knowledge and the <i>real</i> experiments which center on parkour with blocks that grant you different effects; quartz grants Speed, pistons give you Jump Boost, Glass clears any effects, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>why 1.8.8?</h2>
  <p>
    When I excavated the original version of this map, it was dated July 2015 -- ergo Minecraft 1.8.8. It was a better time: command blocks were sort of new; SethBling's grand contraptions just started running on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17AUbVnpc9g">armor stands</a> instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZqrR9FDLOk">minecarts</a>; blocks still had numeric IDs alongside names; I was 10 years old; et cetera. It was originally a showcase of the <span class="code">detect</span> syntax of the new and beloved <span class="code">execute</span> command which lets a command block search for blocks around any entity. Everyone and their mother was making a map where stepping on a block gave you a potion effect.<br>
    I didn't port the map to current version instantly because I thought I was going to polish it up and leave it as a proof of concept. The demo will be released in 1.8.8 (though it should probably work in any subsequent version) just to prove that maps for ancient Minecraft versions are still great fun. However, any full release will be released exclusively in current version for ease of play.
  </p>

  <h2>when will it come out?</h2>
  The demo will be out when it's done; no sooner but probably later. Come back to this page when it releases.
