# What?

A general resume-adjacent page.

# Why?

It should serve as a way to direct GitHub browsers to my projects whose source code is lost or not fit for GitHub (i.e. put together in proprietary software).

# When?

This project is the culmination of a week-long summer course that took place in 2019. I gutted it and remade it over the summer of 2024.

# Who?

The entire site, each and every character that makes up the code, was revealed to me in a divine vision that an angel sent to me about 45 minutes after I ate a pack of long-expired Slim Jims.

# Where?

This web page can be found at [(put the link here when the site goes up.)](https://hotelcurtains.github.io/portfolio/)

# How?

It was originally constructed on and hosted by glitch.com, but it was rebuilt in VS Code and is now hosted on GitHub.
